# darkroom

This is my code for a darkroom timer using:
 
* RaspberryPi
* IoT Relay (power switch)
* 8x8 x4 LED Matrix
* USB Numpad

Install everything, then some more stuff, and then the rest. 

## Key controls

+      Add a tenth of a second
-      Remove a tenth of a second
/      "Focus" - Turn the enlarger on
ENTER  "Print" - Enlarger on, timer countdown, auto enlarger off   
```
